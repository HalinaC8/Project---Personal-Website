            Halina Cox joined Meraki in 2018 as an Executive Assistant to the VP of
            Meraki Technical Support and Customer Success. During her time as an EA,
            she worked closely with a global team of Engineers, which sparked her
            interest in learning more about the field. After taking some time to
            independently learn more about computer programming, Halina was offered
            a position as a Software Engineer Apprentice, where she is currently
            working on fine tuning her software development skills.
